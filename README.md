* HOLD ME CLOSER TERMY DANCERRRRR
** or whatever elton john said


figured out: 
color text
loops
clear console screen

need to figure out: 
sleep
read from file


todo after the bare minimum:
 - function to verify the animation file is formatted right
 - conf file to specify 
   - how many dancers
   - their colors
   - the animation file
 - pass conf file in on terminal
   - ex: termydancer /path/to/some/dance.conf
   
probably better as another project but 
 - script to take a gif
   - split it into frames
   - convert frames to ascii
   - push ascii to a file compatible with this
   - figure an option to tag with color information too
 - a similar program that only recreates a gif in the terminal given a similar animation file but with color tags
